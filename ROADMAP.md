# Roadmap

The following is a list of features that could've been implemented.

- [ ] Probably enhance table component using TanStack Table but that's overkill for this task
- [ ] Make a real API with express (still with mock data)
- [ ] Disable and redirect "/login" route to "/" when user is logged in
- [ ] Add test for ui components (Radix UI components)
- [ ] Preferably migrate to TypeScript
